# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

## Introduction  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.  
  
## Data  
 
The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course website:
* Dataset:  
[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) [60M]  
The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.  
* A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:  
[UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)  

## Assignment  

Create several files:  

- run_analysis.R - R script that does the following:  

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.  
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  
  
- UCI HAR_data.txt - a tidy data set  
  
- CodeBook.md - a code book that describes the data and the variables.
